 * The three scopes this service gates on, and the one place each is spelled.

 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THESE ARE STRING LITERALS AND THEY MUST STAY LITERALS.**
 *
 * The obvious tidy-up is `scopeFor(SERVICE, 'read')`. micro-aetherholm started there and had to
 * undo it: the estate's scope audit rejects a computed demand — "'PROVISION_SCOPE' resolves to no
 * string constant in this repository — fail, do not guess" (`aetherholm/src/server.ts:121`). It is
 * right to. That audit proves every scope a gate demands exists in `contracts-auth`, so identity
 * can actually mint it — identity fail-fasts at import on a grant naming an unknown scope
 * (`identity/src/env.ts:141`), which means a scope missing from the registry is a
 * service-to-service surface no identity-issued token can ever reach, while every suite stays
 * green off its own fake principals.
 *
 * The derivation reads inline literals, sibling constants, wrapper arguments and computed families
 * closed over an enumerated set (`org/.github/workflows/service-ci.yml:495-597`), and treats
 * anything it cannot resolve as FATAL. Making it blind here to make the code prettier would trade
 * a real guarantee for a cosmetic one.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `service:noun`, first segment equal to the service — `contracts/packages/auth/src/index.ts:150-153`.
