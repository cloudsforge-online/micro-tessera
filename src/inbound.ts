/**
 * The inbox: events this service receives from other producers.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **THE SIGNATURE IS VERIFIED OVER THE RAW BYTES, BEFORE THEY ARE PARSED. THE ORDER IS THE
 * SECURITY PROPERTY.**
 *
 * `activity/src/ingest.ts` does this and its header explains why re-serialising
 * before verifying is forbidden: `JSON.parse` then `JSON.stringify` is not the identity function —
 * key order, number formatting and unicode escapes all change — so a MAC recomputed over the
 * re-serialised body is a MAC over different bytes, and every honest delivery is refused while the
 * failure looks like a secret mismatch.
 *
 * Parsing first would also put a JSON parser in front of the authentication, reachable by anyone
 * who can open a socket. `analytics` and `admin-api` both moved their ingest routes to MAC-only
 * for this reason, and `contracts-auth`'s two deprecated scopes record what happened when the
 * bearer was treated as the wall instead.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * And the envelope is judged by `classifyEnvelope`, never by a hand-rolled shape check. Its three
 * verdicts are distinct on purpose and this file keeps them distinct:
 *
 *   * `valid`                — handle it.
 *   * `unregistered_topic`   — the producer emitted something `contracts-events` does not know.
 *                              202, recorded, NOT handled. Refusing with a 4xx would make the
 *                              producer retry for ever; handling it would mean acting on a payload
 *                              with no registered shape.
 *   * `malformed`            — 400 with the defects, which name exactly what the producer must fix.
