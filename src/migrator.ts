/**
 * The one-shot migrator.
 *
 * A separate process, run as an init container or a Kubernetes Job, and **never** called from
 * `index.ts`: a slow migration must not stall the service's health, two replicas booting together
 * must not race on the schema, and a rollback of the image must not silently be a rollback of the
 * database. Safe to run concurrently from N processes — `@cloudsforge/db` serialises them on an
 * advisory lock derived from the service name, and the losers observe an empty pending set.
