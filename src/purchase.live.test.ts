/**
 * A PURCHASE, DRIVEN OVER A REAL SOCKET AGAINST A REAL POSTGRES.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `titlecontract.test.ts`.
 *
 * `titlecontract.test.ts` calls `provision()` and catches what it throws. That is the wrong
 * altitude for the defect this file is about, because the defect was never in what `provision`
 * threw — it was in what the CUSTOMER GOT. A `PostgresError` escaping `provision` matches none of
 * `server.ts`'s error branches and is answered:
 *
 *     500 {"error":{"code":"internal","message":"the request could not be completed"}}
 *
 * to somebody in the middle of buying a Private Ward. A test that asserts `rejects` is green for
 * a 409 and green for a 500, which is exactly the distinction that mattered. So this file speaks
 * HTTP, reads the status line, and would have been red.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── THE ENTITLEMENT IDS ARE THE ESTATE'S OWN, NOT SYNTHETIC ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `worlds/src/conformance.ts`:
 *
 *     const entitlementId = options.entitlementId ?? `conformance-${crypto.randomUUID()}`
 *
 * The slug rule this file replaced was `entitlementId.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '').slice(0, 12)`.
 * Applied to that id: the hyphen is stripped, `conformance` is ELEVEN characters, and the twelfth
 * is the first hex digit of the UUID. **Sixteen slugs, for every conformance run this estate will
 * ever do.** The second run had a fifteen-in-sixteen chance of colliding with the first, and
 * `worlds`' own conformance check would therefore have started 500ing against this title almost
 * immediately — on a route whose whole purpose is to prove the title works.
 *
 * The two ids below are generated the way worlds generates them and then selected for a shared
 * first hex digit, which is not a contrivance: it is the one-in-sixteen that was going to happen.
