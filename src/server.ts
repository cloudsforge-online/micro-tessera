/**
 * The HTTP surface.
 *
 * Plain `node:http`, as the template and aetherholm both are. Rule 4 of docs/ecosystem/03 §2:
 * `/livez`, `/readyz` and `/metrics` on every service, or it does not pass CI.
 *
 * The one decision here that is easy to get backwards is the auth-fault mapping. A bad token is
 * 401. A verifier that could not reach the JWKS is **503**, never 401 — answering 401 there signs
 * every user in the estate out because the identity service is having a bad minute. `statusFor`
 * from `@cloudsforge/auth` is the one place that decides it, so five services cannot disagree.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * EVERY GATE IN THIS FILE DEMANDS A SCOPE THE ESTATE'S DERIVATION CAN READ.
 *
 * `requireScope(principal, LITERAL_CONSTANT)` — the shape `service-ci.yml`'s scope audit resolves
 * (`addGate('requireScope', 1)`, and `resolveExpr` follows a sibling constant to its literal). A
 * gate it cannot resolve is FATAL to the build, deliberately: a demand it cannot read is a demand
 * it cannot prove is registered, and identity fail-fasts at import on a grant naming an unknown
 * scope (`identity/src/env.ts:141`).
 *
 * Verified by running the estate's own extracted audit against this repository, not by reading the
 * workflow: it reports `tessera:provision`, `tessera:read` and `tessera:write`, each naming the
 * line below that demands it.

    // **THE MOSAIC IS PUBLIC. A STRANGER MUST BE ABLE TO SEE THE MAP.**
    //
    // These two routes authenticated every read until now, and a signed-out visitor arriving at
    // Tessera's front door got a 401 — the last failing check in `beacon smoke`. It is fixed here
    // rather than allowed for, because the 401 was wrong, and three separate things say so.
    //
    // **1. The design forbids exactly this.** 23-tessera.md §5 opens the loop with
    //
    //        arrive at the Commons    a browser tab; no download, no plugin, NO ACCOUNT WALL
    //
    //    and §4 builds the whole economy on it: land is free and abundant, the platform never sells
    //    it, supply is elastic and only LOCATION is scarce. A world whose map you must register to
    //    look at has an account wall on the first arrow of its own loop.
    //
    // **2. The estate has already settled this, in these words.** `worlds/src/server.ts:507` serves
    //    the title registry unauthenticated under the note "a launcher listing games cannot require
    //    a token to do it". The Mosaic is that same object one level down: the list of places a
    //    launcher, a search engine or a stranger following a link needs in order to decide to come.
    //
    // **3. It was never a security boundary, only a registration wall.** The projection is
    //    `id, slug, name, archetype, ordinal, claimable_tiles, claimed_tiles, community_id,
    //    instances, opened_at` (`world.ts:230`) — geography and occupancy, not one user-scoped or
    //    money field. And ANY account could already read it, while an account is free and
    //    self-serve. So the 401 excluded nobody it meant to; it only made a public map cost a
    //    signup. That is the test for whether removing a gate weakens authentication, and this one
    //    fails it: no principal could see anything here that anonymous cannot.
    //
    // **`…/:id/parcels` goes with them, and that was decided AFTER the first fix, not with it.**
    // Opening `/v1/wards` alone moved `beacon smoke` from a 401 on the ward list to a 401 on the
    // ward's parcels, one request later — the first had been masking the second. The temptation is
    // then to keep opening routes until a check goes green, which is how a gate gets removed for a
    // reason that is not a reason. So it was decided the same way as the first, from the design:
    //
    //   * §5's loop is "arrive at the Commons … place it; open your gate — a parcel with an open
    //     gate is a place people can enter … someone walks in". The person walking in has, by §5's
    //     own first line, no account. A world you must register to see the buildings of has an
    //     account wall two steps into its loop instead of one.
    //   * `tessera-web` had already written the conclusion down, in the client that renders this
    //     list: *"A shut gate is still openable as a screen — the parcel EXISTS and **the world is
    //     public**. … a world with invisible buildings is a world that feels empty when it is not"*
    //     (`tessera-web/src/pages/world.tsx:128`). Its empty state is "Nothing has been claimed in
    //     this ward yet — **All of it is free.**"
    //   * And it BOUNDS the change rather than starting a slide: the arrivals screen makes exactly
    //     two calls, `listWards` and `listWardParcels`. It does not ask for presence. The next route
    //     out is not needed by any anonymous screen, so this is the end of the opening, not a step
    //     in one.
    //
    // **`ownerSubject` is exposed by this, knowingly.** It is the one field here that refers to a
    // person, and the decision is recorded rather than glossed: it is an opaque uuid with no
    // resolver an anonymous caller can reach; this estate publishes ownership by design already
    // (on chain, and §9.2's Author of record is *derived and public* precisely so it cannot be
    // forged); the screen that renders this list does not display it; and a free, self-serve account
    // could always read it, so the gate was a signup wall and not a boundary. If that trade is ever
    // reconsidered, the answer is to drop the field from THIS route's projection — `GET
    // /v1/parcels/:id` answers "who owns it" and stays gated — not to close the world again.
    //
    // **What stays gated, and why the line is drawn exactly here.** `…/:id/presence` returns a
    // subject with live `x, y` — where a named person is standing, right now. That is not a fact
    // about the world, it is a fact about a body in it, and it is the one thing on this page that
    // could put somebody somewhere. The map and the buildings are public; the room is not.
    //
    // No `authenticate` call at all, matching `worlds`: the response does not vary by principal, so
    // reading a token would be decoration, and a visitor whose access token has merely expired must
    // still see the world rather than an error. `tessera-web`'s `SignedOut` branch on this page
    // (`tessera-web/src/pages/world.tsx:54`) becomes unreachable — it was a workaround for this
    // defect, written by somebody who had already worked out that the page is public.

     * **A USER TOKEN, AND AN ADMIN'S — BOTH HALVES ARE FORCED BY SOMEBODY ELSE'S SOURCE.**
     *
     * `micro-community` refuses a service token on its governance surface, in terms worth
     * quoting because they are right: "A service token is not 'close enough' on the governance
     * surface. It names no user, so there is no membership to check — and accepting one would
     * make every service in the estate a voting member of every community"
     * (`community/src/server.ts`, `authenticateUser`). And `POST /v1/communities` takes the owner
     * from the token, never from the body (`:547`).
     *
     * So Tessera cannot found a ward's community with `TESSERA_SERVICE_CREDENTIAL`, and the
     * founder becomes the community's owner and first admin. A ward is platform-minted, so
     * founding its government is a platform act — which makes `isAdmin` the gate, and makes the
     * relayed token an operator's rather than any player's.
     *
     * What this route deliberately does NOT do is the point of it: no proposal, no vote, no
     * officer, no timelock, no treasury. Those exist in `micro-community` and Tessera consumes
     * their outcome as `community.proposal.executed` (`inbound.ts`). §10 — "keeps the change
     * count in `micro-community` at zero and puts the game logic in the game."
