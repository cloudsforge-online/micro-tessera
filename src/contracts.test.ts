/**
 * The agreements with `contracts-events` and `contracts-auth`, from the PRODUCER's side.
 *
 * `micro-contracts`' own tests prove the registry says what was decided. They cannot prove the
 * producer still passes it — §11.2 records that as "a question no test here can ask" from inside
 * the contract package. This file is that question, asked from the side that holds the emit sites.
 *
 * The defect this exists for is named in the registry itself: `custody` registered both ceremony
 * topics `keyedBy: 'user_id'` while the emit sites passed the ADDRESS, and `activity` reads the
 * envelope key AS the user id — so every export event was filed against a user who does not exist,
 * for months, with both repositories' suites green.
