/**
 * The market seam and ward governance — and the two refusals they exist to make provable.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * **EVERY SCHEMA TEST HERE HITS THE CONSTRAINT DIRECTLY, WITH RAW SQL.**
 *
 * That is the finding this repository already paid for once. Its first pass ran 23 mutations one
 * at a time, and the one that did NOT go red was `tessera_objects_are_their_bytes`: dropping the
 * unique index left the copybot test green, because the test graded an `if` inside `completeFiring`
 * rather than asking the index. A test that exercises a handler proves the handler; only a raw
 * INSERT or UPDATE proves the schema.
 *
 * So each constraint below is tested twice on purpose: once through `activateListing`, which is
 * how a user meets it, and once with a raw statement that bypasses every line of TypeScript in
 * this repository, which is how a bug, a migration, a backfill or an operator with a psql
 * connection meets it.

 * The @cloudsforge/ui defect, refused. It posted the SSO callback to `/auth/exchange`, a route
 * identity has never served, and the test pinning it compared the URL against a copy of itself so
 * it could never fail. This reads micro-market's and micro-community's OWN server sources and
 * asserts they define every path this client calls. It cannot pass against a route that does not
 * exist, because the other side of the comparison is the other repository.
 *
 * ── A MISSING SIBLING IS A SKIP, AND NEVER A `return` ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to be neither: `readFileSync` on a checkout that is not there threw ENOENT and FAILED
 * the run — `not ok 89 … ENOENT … /market/src/server.ts` in this repository's first honest CI run.
 * micro-org's service workflow checks out micro-runtime and micro-contracts and no other sibling,
 * so a per-service job has neither of the two repositories this test compares against.
 *
 * A red run for "the estate is not all here" is the same lie as a green one for work that never
 * happened: both say something about micro-market that this job did not measure. So it skips, and
 * `t.skip()` rather than `return` — `return` marks it GREEN, which is the failure `citations.test.ts`
 * opens by naming and the reason `citeIfPresent` exists at all. Where the siblings ARE present —
 * an estate checkout, and `deploy/scripts/estate-verify.sh` — every assertion below runs unchanged.
