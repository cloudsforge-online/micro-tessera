# Build context is this repository, plus two named contexts for the unpublished sibling packages:
#
#   docker build -t aetherholm \
#     --build-context runtimepkgs=../runtime \
#     --build-context contractspkgs=../contracts .
#
# Both extra contexts are temporary. Once the @cloudsforge/* packages are published (AD-02),
# package.json takes registry versions, the COPY lines marked below are deleted, the flags go away,
# and this becomes an ordinary single-context build. Nothing else changes.
#
# They are named `runtimepkgs`/`contractspkgs` rather than `runtime`/`contracts` because a build
# context and a build stage share one namespace, and the final stage below is called `runtime`.

FROM node:22-slim AS deps
# Pin pnpm in the image. The sibling workspaces are installed before this service's own
# package.json is copied, so corepack has no packageManager field to read at that point and
# would otherwise grab whatever is latest and then refuse to switch to the 11.9.0 the
# siblings pin.

# Temporary: the link: dependencies resolve to ../runtime relative to this directory, so the
# packages must exist at those paths inside the image for the lockfile to stay frozen. The
# contracts context is carried even though this service's manifest does not name a contracts
# package today: the reusable image job passes both contexts unconditionally, and a context the
# Dockerfile ignores would silently mask a future dependency.

# THESE TWO LINES WERE MISSING while the header above already documented the contractspkgs
# context: the prose was copied from identity's Dockerfile, the COPY lines were not, and a check
# that grepped for 'contractspkgs' matched the comment and reported the wiring present. The
# estate's guard-reads-its-own-prose defect, in a Dockerfile.

# Install the siblings' OWN dependencies first. `link:` uses the sibling as-is and does not
# manage its dependency tree, so /runtime's node_modules must exist independently — both for
# `tsc` to resolve the sibling source it typechecks (jose, @opentelemetry/api) and for
# `node --import tsx` to load @cloudsforge/* at run time.

# `--frozen-lockfile` is the point of the step: a build that silently resolves a different
# dependency tree from the one CI tested is a build whose provenance means nothing.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- build

# service in the estate already does. What this stage buys is that a type error fails the image
# build instead of the first request.

# No corepack, no pnpm, no build toolchain in the final image: fewer things an RCE can reach, and
# nothing at runtime needs them. The runtime sibling comes across too: /app/node_modules holds
# @cloudsforge/* as symlinks into it, so without the target the links dangle and the first
# `import '@cloudsforge/db'` fails at run time.

# And /contracts — the deps stage grew it, the runtime stage must carry it, or tsx dies at the
# first import with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND while typecheck (which ran in the build stage, where
# /contracts exists) stays green. The second half of the same half-copied wiring.

# The health endpoints are for the orchestrator, not for the image: the balancer probes /readyz and

# The migrator is a SEPARATE one-shot process — `node --import tsx src/migrator.ts` — run as an
# init container or a Kubernetes Job before this ever starts. It is deliberately not invoked here:
# below SCHEMA_VERSION the outbox/inbox tables and the city-stock CHECKs may not exist, and the
# one-city-per-island partial unique is what keeps two requests from founding twice. A service
# that could create the schema at boot is a service that could start without it. `index.ts`
# asserts the schema version and refuses to serve below it.
